The values for year, month and day are still correct though. \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI'd expect the value provided in the `hour` param to be set to the hour, and not the minutes. \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\r\\npython                : 3.11.10\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: Mon Jul 29 21:13:04 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.141.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : i386\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.4\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npytest                : 8.3.3\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

For example, something like this should work:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'workweek' : [4, 5, 6, 4], 'income' : ['low', 'middle', 'high', 'low']})\\r\\ndf['income'] = df['income'].astype('category').cat.set_categories(['low', 'middle', 'high'], ordered=True)\\r\\ndf.corr(method='spearman')\\r\\n```\\r\\nYet it throws ``ValueError``, since it cannot convert string ``low`` to float.

In the case that this dtype is an instance of potentially multiple variants of a logical dtype (for example, string backed by python or backed by pyarrow), how do you check for the \"logical\" equality of such dtypes?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor checking the logical equality for one series, you have the option to compare it with the generic string alias (which will return True for any variant of it) or checking the dtype with `isinstance` or some `is_..._dtype` (although we have deprecated some of those). Using string dtype as the example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nser.dtype == \"string\"\\r\\n# or\\r\\nisinstance(ser.dtype, pd.StringDtype)\\r\\npd.api.types.is_string_dtype(ser.dtype)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you want to check if two serieses have the same dtype, the `==` will check for exact equality (in the string dtype example, the below can evaluate to False even if both are a StringDtype, but have a different storage):\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nser1.dtype == ser2.dtype\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**But so how to check this logical equality for two dtypes?** In the example, how to know that both dtypes are representing the same logical dtype (i.e. both a StringDtype instance), without necessarily wanting to check the exact type (i.e. the user doesn\\'t necessarily know it are string dtypes, just want to check if they are logically the same)\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n# this might work?\\r\\ntype(ser1.dtype) == type(ser2.dtype)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nDo we want some other API here that is a bit more user friendly? (just brainstorming, something like `dtype1.is_same_type(dtype2)`, or a function, ..)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is important in the discussion around logical dtypes (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/58455), but so it is already an issue for the new string dtype as well in pandas 3.0\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @WillAyd @Dr-Irv @jbrockmendel (tagging some people that were most active in the logical dtypes discussion)\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'Historically, the `.values` attribute returned a numpy array (except for categoricals). When we added more ExtensionArrays, for certain dtypes (e.g. tz-aware timestamps, or periods, ..) the EA could more faithfully represent the underlying values instead of the lossy conversion to numpy (e.g for tz-aware timestamps we decided to return a numpy object dtype array instead of \"datetime64[ns]\" to not lose the timezone information). At that point, instead of \"breaking\" the behaviour of `.values`, we decided to add an `.array` attribute that then always returns the EA.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for generic ExtensionArrays (external, or non-default EAs like the masked ones or the Arrow ones), the `.values` has always already directly returned the EA as well. So in those cases, there is no difference between `.values` and `.array`.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to the point: with the new default `StringDtype`, the current behaviour is indeed to also always return the EA for both `.values` and `.array`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means this is one of the breaking changes for users when upgrading to pandas 3.0, that for a column which is inferred as string data, the `.values` no longer returns a numpy array.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Are we OK with this breaking change now?**  \\r\\nOr, we could also decide to keep `.values` return the numpy array with `.array` returning the EA. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, when we would move to use EAs for all dtypes (which is being considered in the logical dtypes and missing values PDEP discussions), then we would have this breaking change as well (or at least need to make a decision about it). But, that could also be a reason to not yet do it for the string dtype now, if we would change it for all dtypes later.\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @pandas-dev/pandas-core \\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

It does something with `subplots=False` (the default) as well, except it's not clear what and it doesn't make much sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy suggestion would be, in the case that `subplots=False`, to either ignore `sharex` (and `sharey`?) altogether or warn when it is specified (or both).\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Historically, the default value for the string storage (globally configurable through `pd.options.mode.string_storage`) of `StringDtype` was `\"python\"`, and users needed to explicitly ask for `\"pyarrow\"`. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> ser = pd.Series([\"a\", \"b\"], dtype=\"string\")\\r\\n>>>  ser.dtype\\r\\nstring[python]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nand this is still the behaviour on `main`.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the new NaN-variant of `StringDtype`, however, we implemented the default string storage option `\"auto\"` meaning \"use pyarrow if installed, otherwise use python\". So on a system with pyarrow installed:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> pd.options.future.infer_string = True\\r\\n>>> ser = pd.Series([\"a\", \"b\"], dtype=\"str\")\\r\\n>>> ser.dtype.storage\\r\\n\\'pyarrow\\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nEssentially we interpret the default `string_storage` option setting of `\"auto\"` differently for the NaN vs NA variant of the string dtype, which you can see in the code here:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/5f23aced2f97f2ed481deda4eaeeb049d6c7debe/pandas/core/arrays/string_.py#L152-L163\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n__Proposal__: I think it makes sense to also switch to \"pyarrow\" as the default string storage (if installed) for the nullable StringDtype. This is somewhat a breaking change (although mostly for the dtype object itself, because behaviour-wise for string operations, there should be hardly any difference between both backends), so I would keep this for 3.0 and properly document it in the whatsnew notes.\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'I noticed that in certain cases, when replacing a value with `None`, that we always cast to object dtype, regardless of whether the dtype of the calling series can actually hold None (at least, when considering `None` just as a generic  \"missing value\" indicator).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, a float Series can hold `None` in the sense of holding missing values, which is how `None` is treated in setitem:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> ser = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype=\"float\")\\r\\n>>> ser[1] = None\\r\\n>>> ser\\r\\n0    1.0\\r\\n1    NaN\\r\\n2    3.0\\r\\ndtype: float64\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when using `replace()` to change the value 2.0 with None, it depends on the exact way to specify the to_replace/value combo, but typically it will upcast to object:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n# with list\\r\\n>>> ser.replace([1, 2], [10, None])\\r\\n0    10.0\\r\\n1    None\\r\\n2     3.0\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\n# with Series -> here it gives NaN but that is because the Series constructor already coerces the None\\r\\n>>> ser.replace(pd.Series({1: 10, 2: None}))\\r\\n0    10.0\\r\\n1     NaN\\r\\n2     3.0\\r\\ndtype: float64\\r\\n\\r\\n# with scalar replacements\\r\\n>>> ser.replace(1, 10).replace(2, None)\\r\\n0    10.0\\r\\n1    None\\r\\n2     3.0\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n```\\r\\nIn all the above cases, when replacing `None` with `np.nan`, it of course just results in a float Series with NaN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for this is two-fold. First, in `Block._replace_coerce` there is a check specifically for `value is None` and in that case we always cast to object dtype:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/5f23aced2f97f2ed481deda4eaeeb049d6c7debe/pandas/core/internals/blocks.py#L906-L910\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is used when replacing with a list of values. But for the scalar case, we also cast to object dtype because in this case we check for `if self._can_hold_element(value)` to do the replacement with a simple setitem (and if not cast to object dtype first before trying again). But it seems that `can_hold_element(np.array([], dtype=float), None)` gives False .. \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything is tested with current main (3.0.0.dev), but I see the same behaviour on older releases (2.0 and 1.5)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat related issue:\\r\\n\\r\\n* https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/29024',\n",
